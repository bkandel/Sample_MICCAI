  abstract = {This paper compares the statistical power of BOLD and arterial spin
	labeling perfusion fMRI for a variety of experimental designs within
	and across subjects. Based on theory and simulations, we predict
	that perfusion data are composed of independent observations in time
	under the null hypothesis, in contrast to BOLD data, which possess
	marked autocorrelation. We also present a method (sinc subtraction)
	of generating perfusion data from its raw source signal that minimizes
	the presence of oxygen-sensitive signal changes and can be used with
	any experimental design. Empirically, we demonstrate the absence
	of autocorrelation in perfusion noise, examine the shape of the hemodynamic
	response function for BOLD and perfusion, and obtain a measure of
	signal to noise for each method. This information is then used to
	generate a model of relative sensitivity of the BOLD and perfusion
	methods for within-subject experimental designs of varying temporal
	frequency. It is determined that perfusion fMRI provides superior
	sensitivity for within-subject experimental designs that concentrate
	their power at or below approximately 0.009 Hz (corresponding to
	a "blocked" experimental design of 60-s epochs). Additionally, evidence
	is presented that across-subject hypothesis tests may be more sensitive
	when conducted using perfusion imaging, despite the better within-subject
	signal to noise obtained in some cases with BOLD.},

  abstract = {Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of the
	genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging
	community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms
	for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without
	the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional
	MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing
	this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude
	spontaneous low-frequency (<0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal
	that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas.
	Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield
	detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting
	an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets
	and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture,
	yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features,
	with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity
	patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome,
	and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and
	brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative
	datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data
	from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international
	centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and
	negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual
	variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These
	results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated
	and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes
	for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and
	pathological processes in the brain. To initiate discovery science
	of brain function, the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset
	is freely accessible at www.nitrc.org/projects/fcon_1000/.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To assess cognitive impairment and depression in aging
	former professional football (National Football League [NFL]) players
	and to identify neuroimaging correlates of these dysfunctions. DESIGN
	We compared former NFL players with cognitive impairment and depression,
	cognitively normal retired players who were not depressed, and matched
	healthy control subjects. SETTING Research center in the North Texas
	region of the United States. PATIENTS Cross-sectional sample of former
	NFL players with and without a history of concussion recruited from
	the North Texas region and age-, education-, and IQ-matched controls.
	Thirty-four retired NFL players (mean age, 61.8 years) underwent
	neurological and neuropsychological assessment. A subset of 26 players
	also underwent detailed neuroimaging; imaging data in this subset
	were compared with imaging data acquired in 26 healthy matched controls.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neuropsychological measures, clinical diagnoses
	of depression, neuroimaging mea-sures of white matter pathology,
	and a measure of cerebral blood flow. RESULTS Of the 34 former NFL
	players, 20 were cognitively normal. Four were diagnosed as having
	a fixed cognitive deficit; 8, mild cognitive impairment; 2, dementia;
	and 8, depression. Of the subgroup in whom neuroimaging data were
	acquired, cognitively impaired participants showed the greatest deficits
	on tests of naming, word finding, and visual/verbal episodic memory.
	We found significant differences in white matter abnormalities in
	cognitively impaired and depressed retired players compared with
	their respective controls. Regional blood flow differences in the
	cognitively impaired group (left temporal pole, inferior parietal
	lobule, and superior temporal gyrus) corresponded to regions associated
	with impaired neurocognitive performance (problems with memory, naming,
	and word finding). CONCLUSIONS Cognitive deficits and depression
	appear to be more common in aging former NFL players compared with
	healthy controls. These deficits are correlated with white matter
	abnormalities and changes in regional cerebral blood flow.},

  abstract = {Consistent resting brain activity patterns have been repeatedly demonstrated
	using measures derived from resting BOLD fMRI data. While those metrics
	are presumed to reflect underlying spontaneous brain activity (SBA),
	it is challenging to prove that association because resting BOLD
	fMRI metrics are purely model-free and scale-free variables. Cerebral
	blood flow (CBF) is typically closely coupled to brain metabolism
	and is used as a surrogate marker for quantifying regional brain
	function, including resting function. Assessing the correlations
	between resting BOLD fMRI measures and CBF correlation should provide
	a means of linking of those measures to the underlying SBA, and a
	means to quantify those scale-free measures. The purpose of this
	paper was to examine the CBF correlations of 3 widely used neuroimaging-based
	SBA measures, including seed-region based functional connectivity
	(FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and amplitude of low frequency
	fluctuation (ALFF). Test-retest data were acquired to check the stability
	of potential correlations across time. Reproducible posterior cingulate
	cortex (PCC) FC vs regional CBF correlations were found in much of
	the default mode network and visual cortex. Dorsal anterior cingulate
	cortex (ACC) FC vs CBF correlations were consistently found in bilateral
	prefrontal cortex. Both ReHo and ALFF were found to be reliably correlated
	with CBF in most of brain cortex. None of the assessed SBA measures
	was correlated with whole brain mean CBF. These findings suggest
	that resting BOLD fMRI-derived measures are coupled with regional
	CBF and are therefore linked to regional SBA.},

  abstract = {Graph theory is a valuable framework to study the organization of
	functional and anatomical connections in the brain. Its use for comparing
	network topologies, however, is not without difficulties. Graph measures
	may be influenced by the number of nodes (N) and the average degree
	(k) of the network. The explicit form of that influence depends on
	the type of network topology, which is usually unknown for experimental
	data. Direct comparisons of graph measures between empirical networks
	with different N and/or k can therefore yield spurious results. We
	list benefits and pitfalls of various approaches that intend to overcome
	these difficulties. We discuss the initial graph definition of unweighted
	graphs via fixed thresholds, average degrees or edge densities, and
	the use of weighted graphs. For instance, choosing a threshold to
	fix N and k does eliminate size and density effects but may lead
	to modifications of the network by enforcing (ignoring) non-significant
	(significant) connections. Opposed to fixing N and k, graph measures
	are often normalized via random surrogates but, in fact, this may
	even increase the sensitivity to differences in N and k for the commonly
	used clustering coefficient and small-world index. To avoid such
	a bias we tried to estimate the N,k-dependence for empirical networks,
	which can serve to correct for size effects, if successful. We also
	add a number of methods used in social sciences that build on statistics
	of local network structures including exponential random graph models
	and motif counting. We show that none of the here-investigated methods
	allows for a reliable and fully unbiased comparison, but some perform
	better than others.},

  abstract = {We describe here experimental considerations in the implementation
	of quantitative perfusion imaging techniques for functional MRI using
	pulsed arterial spin labeling. Three tagging techniques: EPISTAR,
	PICORE, and FAIR are found to give very similar perfusion results
	despite large differences in static tissue contrast. Two major sources
	of systematic error in the perfusion measurement are identified:
	the transit delay from the tagging region to the imaging slice; and
	the inclusion of intravascular tagged signal. A modified technique
	called QUIPSS II is described that decreases sensitivity to these
	effects by explicitly controlling the time width of the tag bolus
	and imaging after the bolus is entirely deposited into the slice.
	With appropriate saturation pulses the pulse sequence can be arranged
	so as to allow for simultaneous collection of perfusion and BOLD
	data that can be cleanly separated. Such perfusion and BOLD signals
	reveal differences in spatial location and dynamics that may be useful
	both for functional brain mapping and for study of the BOLD contrast
	mechanism. The implementation of multislice perfusion imaging introduces
	additional complications, primarily in the elimination of signal
	from static tissue. In pulsed ASL, this appears to be related to
	the slice profile of the inversion tag pulse in the presence of relaxation,
	rather than magnetization transfer effects as in continuous arterial
	spin labeling, and can be alleviated with careful adjustment of inversion
	pulse parameters.},
