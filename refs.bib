  abstract = {Consistent resting brain activity patterns have been repeatedly demonstrated
	using measures derived from resting BOLD fMRI data. While those metrics
	are presumed to reflect underlying spontaneous brain activity (SBA),
	it is challenging to prove that association because resting BOLD
	fMRI metrics are purely model-free and scale-free variables. Cerebral
	blood flow (CBF) is typically closely coupled to brain metabolism
	and is used as a surrogate marker for quantifying regional brain
	function, including resting function. Assessing the correlations
	between resting BOLD fMRI measures and CBF correlation should provide
	a means of linking of those measures to the underlying SBA, and a
	means to quantify those scale-free measures. The purpose of this
	paper was to examine the CBF correlations of 3 widely used neuroimaging-based
	SBA measures, including seed-region based functional connectivity
	(FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and amplitude of low frequency
	fluctuation (ALFF). Test-retest data were acquired to check the stability
	of potential correlations across time. Reproducible posterior cingulate
	cortex (PCC) FC vs regional CBF correlations were found in much of
	the default mode network and visual cortex. Dorsal anterior cingulate
	cortex (ACC) FC vs CBF correlations were consistently found in bilateral
	prefrontal cortex. Both ReHo and ALFF were found to be reliably correlated
	with CBF in most of brain cortex. None of the assessed SBA measures
	was correlated with whole brain mean CBF. These findings suggest
	that resting BOLD fMRI-derived measures are coupled with regional
	CBF and are therefore linked to regional SBA.},
