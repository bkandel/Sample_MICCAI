  abstract = {OBJECTIVES To assess cognitive impairment and depression in aging
	former professional football (National Football League [NFL]) players
	and to identify neuroimaging correlates of these dysfunctions. DESIGN
	We compared former NFL players with cognitive impairment and depression,
	cognitively normal retired players who were not depressed, and matched
	healthy control subjects. SETTING Research center in the North Texas
	region of the United States. PATIENTS Cross-sectional sample of former
	NFL players with and without a history of concussion recruited from
	the North Texas region and age-, education-, and IQ-matched controls.
	Thirty-four retired NFL players (mean age, 61.8 years) underwent
	neurological and neuropsychological assessment. A subset of 26 players
	also underwent detailed neuroimaging; imaging data in this subset
	were compared with imaging data acquired in 26 healthy matched controls.
	MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Neuropsychological measures, clinical diagnoses
	of depression, neuroimaging mea-sures of white matter pathology,
	and a measure of cerebral blood flow. RESULTS Of the 34 former NFL
	players, 20 were cognitively normal. Four were diagnosed as having
	a fixed cognitive deficit; 8, mild cognitive impairment; 2, dementia;
	and 8, depression. Of the subgroup in whom neuroimaging data were
	acquired, cognitively impaired participants showed the greatest deficits
	on tests of naming, word finding, and visual/verbal episodic memory.
	We found significant differences in white matter abnormalities in
	cognitively impaired and depressed retired players compared with
	their respective controls. Regional blood flow differences in the
	cognitively impaired group (left temporal pole, inferior parietal
	lobule, and superior temporal gyrus) corresponded to regions associated
	with impaired neurocognitive performance (problems with memory, naming,
	and word finding). CONCLUSIONS Cognitive deficits and depression
	appear to be more common in aging former NFL players compared with
	healthy controls. These deficits are correlated with white matter
	abnormalities and changes in regional cerebral blood flow.},

  abstract = {Consistent resting brain activity patterns have been repeatedly demonstrated
	using measures derived from resting BOLD fMRI data. While those metrics
	are presumed to reflect underlying spontaneous brain activity (SBA),
	it is challenging to prove that association because resting BOLD
	fMRI metrics are purely model-free and scale-free variables. Cerebral
	blood flow (CBF) is typically closely coupled to brain metabolism
	and is used as a surrogate marker for quantifying regional brain
	function, including resting function. Assessing the correlations
	between resting BOLD fMRI measures and CBF correlation should provide
	a means of linking of those measures to the underlying SBA, and a
	means to quantify those scale-free measures. The purpose of this
	paper was to examine the CBF correlations of 3 widely used neuroimaging-based
	SBA measures, including seed-region based functional connectivity
	(FC), regional homogeneity (ReHo), and amplitude of low frequency
	fluctuation (ALFF). Test-retest data were acquired to check the stability
	of potential correlations across time. Reproducible posterior cingulate
	cortex (PCC) FC vs regional CBF correlations were found in much of
	the default mode network and visual cortex. Dorsal anterior cingulate
	cortex (ACC) FC vs CBF correlations were consistently found in bilateral
	prefrontal cortex. Both ReHo and ALFF were found to be reliably correlated
	with CBF in most of brain cortex. None of the assessed SBA measures
	was correlated with whole brain mean CBF. These findings suggest
	that resting BOLD fMRI-derived measures are coupled with regional
	CBF and are therefore linked to regional SBA.},
